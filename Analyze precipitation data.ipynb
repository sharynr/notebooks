You learned how to use the preinstalled `pandas` library to explore and analyze precipitation data to gain insights about the distribution of precipitation in 91 countries and detect trends. You learned to use the `matplotlib` libraries to visualize your results in different ways, for example as bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs. "
